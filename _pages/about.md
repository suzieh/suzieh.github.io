***Computer Science Ph.D. candidate*** in [Knights Lab](https://www.knightslab.org/) at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Dan Knights](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/dan-knights). My research focuses on solving data science problems in microbiome analysis, specifically enabling stronger statistical approaches by means of matrix theory and machine learning.

Currently, I am primarily leading microbiome analysis for an [infant gut study](https://www.research.chop.edu/magic-study) following 500 infants from birth to 2 years of age. We are seeking to understand how the developing human gut is impacted by factors in their birth, environment, and more.

Previously, I obtained a M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in 2023, was awarded a [Fulbright Combined Award](https://www.fulbright.at/programs/in-austria/students/grant-details/combined-grant-study-research-and-teaching-assistantship) to Austria in 2017-2018, and obtained my B.A. in Mathematics from [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) in 2017. My journey to this Ph.D. and bioinformatics research began with my passion for applied math and has blossomed into explorations of human health, where I believe I can have the greatest impact.
