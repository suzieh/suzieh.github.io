***Computer Science Ph.D. candidate*** in [Knights Lab](https://www.knightslab.org/) at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Dan Knights](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/dan-knights). My research focuses on <span style="color:purple;">solving data science problems</span> in microbiome analysis, specifically enabling stronger statistical approaches by means of matrix theory and machine learning.

Currently, I am leading microbiome analysis for an [infant gut study](https://www.research.chop.edu/magic-study) following 500 infants from birth to 2 years of age. We are seeking to understand how the developing human gut is impacted by factors in their birth, environment, and more. Analyzing and writing results (keep an eye on [my Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oajh7cMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for publications) for four other human gut microbiome studies, both observational and clinical.

Previously, I obtained a M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in 2023, was awarded a [Fulbright Combined Award](https://www.fulbright.at/programs/in-austria/students/grant-details/combined-grant-study-research-and-teaching-assistantship) to Austria in 2017-2018, and obtained my B.A. in Mathematics from [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) in 2017.
